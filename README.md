# Task

1) I've added an input bar in which the user can type the items they want to add. This is done by taking an input value and using onChnageText to read and store it.
2) Then I've created an array(can be empty but I've added two values in it).
3) After that I've used fontAwesome icon, if the user clicks on the Plus button then the item that user has typed will be entered into the array.
4) Lastly I've mapped the array and displayed the list.
